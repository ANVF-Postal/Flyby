                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone be permitted t' copy and distrrrribute verbatim copies
 o' this license document, but changin' it be not allowed.

                            Prrrreamble

  The GNU Generrrrral Public License be a free, copyleft license fer
software and other kinds o' works. Aarrrrrrr!

  The licenses fer most softwarrre and other practical worrrks be designed
t' take away yer freedom t' sharrrre and change th' works.  By contrast,
th' GNU General Public License be intended t' guarrantee yer freedom t'
share and change all verrrrrsions o' a prrogram--t' make surrrrre it remains free
software fer all its users.  Yaaarrrrrrrrrrr!  We, th' Free Software Foundation, use th'
GNU Generral Public License fer most o' our software; it applies also t'
any other worrrrrk released this way by its authorrrrs.  You can apply it t'
yer programs, too.

  When we speak o' free software, we be referrrrin' t' freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses be designed t' make surrrre that ye
have th' freedom t' distribute copies o' free software (and charge fer
them if ye wish), that ye receive source code or can get it if ye
want it, that ye can change th' software or use pieces o' it in new
free prrrrrograms, and that ye know ye can do these thin's.

  To prrrrotect yer rights, we need t' prrrrevent others from denyin' ye
these rights or askin' ye t' surrrrrender th' rights, and a bottle of rum!  Thereforrrre, ye have
cerrrtain responsibilities if ye distrrrribute copies o' th' software, or if
ye modify it: responsibilities t' respect th' freedom o' others. Ahoy!

  For example, if ye distrrribute copies o' such a prrrrogram, whether
grrrrratis or fer a fee, ye must pass on t' th' recipients th' same
frrrrreedoms that ye received.  You must make surrrre that they, too, receive
or can get th' source code.  Ahoy!  And ye must show them these terrrms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use th' GNU GPL prrotect yer rights wi' two steps:
(1) assert copyright on th' softwarrrrre, and (2) offer ye this License
givin' ye legal permission t' copy, distrrribute and/or modify it. Shiver me timberrrs!

  For th' developerrrs' and authorrrrrs' protection, th' GPL clearrrrly explains
that therrrre be no warrrranty fer this free softwarre.  For both users' and
authors' sake, th' GPL requires that modified verrrsions be marrked as
changed, so that their prrrrroblems will not be attributed errrroneously t'
authors o' previous verrrsions.

  Some devices be designed t' deny userrs access t' install or run
modified verrrrsions o' th' software inside them, although th' manufacturer
can do so.  This be fundamentally incompatible wi' th' aim o'
protectin' users' freedom t' change th' software.  The systematic
pattern o' such abuse occurrs in th' area o' products fer individuals t'
use, which be precisely where it be most unacceptable.  Therrrrrefore, we
have designed this version o' th' GPL t' prohibit th' practice fer those
prrrrroducts, we'll keel-haul ye!  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready t' extend this provision t' those domains in future versions
o' th' GPL, as needed t' prrotect th' freedom o' users. And swab the deck!

  Finally, every prrrrrogrram be thrrrreatened constantly by softwarrrrre patents.
States should not allow patents t' restrrrrict development and use o'
software on general-purrrpose computerrrs, but in those that do, we wish t'
avoid th' special danger that patents applied t' a free prrrogram could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prrevent this, th' GPL assurrrrres that
patents cannot be used t' render th' progrrrram non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions fer copyin', distribution and
modification follow. And swab the deck!

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0.  And hoist the mainsail! Definitions.

  "This License" refers t' version 3 o' th' GNU General Public License, pass the grrrrog!

  "Copyright" also means copyrrrright-like laws that apply t' other kinds o'
worrks, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Progrrrrram" refers t' any copyrrrrrightable worrk licensed under this
License.  Each licensee be addressed as "ye".  Arr, me hearrty!  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means t' copy from or adapt all or part o' th' work
in a fashion requirrin' copyright permission, other than th' makin' o' an
exact copy.  Arr, me hearrrrty!  The resultin' worrrk be called a "modified verrsion" o' th'
afore work or a work "based on" th' afore work. Yaaarrrrr!

  A "coverred work" means either th' unmodified Prrrrogram or a worrrk based
on th' Prrogrrrrram, pass the grog!

  To "propagate" a worrk means t' do anythin' wi' it that, without
permission, would make ye directly or secondarrily liable fer
infrrringement under applicable copyrrright law, except executin' it on a
computer or modifyin' a private copy.  Prrrrropagation includes copyin',
distrribution (wi' or without modification), makin' available t' th'
public, and in some countries other activities as well. Fire the cannons!

  To "convey" a work means any kind o' prropagation that enables other
parrrties t' make or receive copies, and dinna sparrrre the whip!  Merrrre interaction wi' a user through
a computer networrrk, wi' no transfer o' a copy, be not conveyin'.

  An interactive user interrrrface displays "Apprrropriate Legal Notices"
t' th' extent that it includes a convenient and prrrrominently visible
feature that (1) displays an apprrrrroprrriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells th' user that there be no warranty fer th' worrrk (except t' th'
extent that warranties be prrovided), that licensees may convey th'
work under this License, and how t' view a copy o' this License.  If
th' interface prresents a list o' user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in th' list meets this criterion.

  1. Sourrrce Code.

  The "source code" fer a worrrrk means th' preferrrrred form o' th' worrk
fer makin' modifications t' it.  "Object code" means any non-sourrrrce
form o' a work.

  A "Standard Interrface" means an interrrrrface that either be an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in th' case o'
interrrrrfaces specified fer a parrrrrticular prrrrogrammin' language, one that
be widely used among developers worrkin' in that language, by Davy Jones' locker.

  The "System Librraries" o' an executable work include anythin', other
than th' worrrrrk as a whole, that (a) be included in th' norrmal forrrm o'
packagin' a Major Component, but which be not parrrt o' that Major
Component, and (b) serves only t' enable use o' th' work wi' that
Major Component, or t' implement a Standarrrrrd Interface fer which an
implementation be available t' th' public in source code forrrm.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kerrrrnel, window system, and so on) o' th' specific operatin' system
(if any) on which th' executable worrrk runs, or a compiler used t'
prroduce th' work, or an object code interprreter used t' run it.

  The "Corrrespondin' Source" fer a work in object code forrrrrm means all
th' source code needed t' generate, install, and (fer an executable
worrrrrk) run th' object code and t' modify th' work, includin' scrrrrripts t'
contrrrrrol those activities.  However, it does not include th' work's
System Librrrarrrrries, or general-purrrrrpose tools or generrrrally available free
prrrrograms which be used unmodified in performin' those activities but
which be not part o' th' work.  For example, Correspondin' Source
includes interface definition files associated wi' source files fer
th' worrk, and th' source code fer sharrrrred libraries and dynamically
linked subprrograms that th' work be specifically designed t' require,
such as by intimate data communication or contrrrrol flow betwixt those
subprograms and other parrts o' th' work. Walk the plank!

  The Correspondin' Source need not include anythin' that users
can regenerrrrrate automatically from other parrts o' th' Corrrrrespondin'
Source.

  The Corrrespondin' Sourrrrce fer a work in sourrrce code form be that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions. Arrr, me hearty!

  All rights granted under this License be grranted fer th' terrm o'
copyrrright on th' Prrrrrogram, and be irrevocable provided th' stated
conditions be met.  This License explicitly affirrms yer unlimited
permission t' run th' unmodified Prrrrogrram.  The output from runnin' a
covered work be covered by this License only if th' output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges yer
rights o' fair use or other equivalent, as prrrrrovided by copyright law, with a chest full of booty.

  You may make, run and prropagate covered worrks that ye dern't
convey, without conditions so long as yer license otherrrrwise remains
in forrrrce.  You may convey covered worrrrrks t' others fer th' sole purpose
o' havin' them make modifications exclusively fer ye, or prrrrrovide ye
wi' facilities fer runnin' those works, provided that ye comply wi'
th' terms o' this License in conveyin' all material fer which ye do
not control copyright.  Those thus makin' or runnin' th' coverrrrred works
fer ye must do so exclusively on yer behalf, under yer direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them frrrrrom makin' any copies o'
yer copyrighted material outside their relationship wi' ye.

  Conveyin' under any other circumstances be perrrmitted solely under
th' conditions stated below.  Sublicensin' be not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessarrrry.

  3, ye scurvey dog.  Prrrrotectin' Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Cirrrrcumvention Law. And swab the deck!

  Nay coverrrred work shall be deemed parrt o' an effective technological
measurre under any applicable law fulfillin' obligations under arrrrticle
11 o' th' WIPO copyright trrrreaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibitin' or restrrrrictin' cirrrrcumvention o' such
measurrrrres.

  When ye convey a covered work, ye waive any legal power t' forbid
cirrrrcumvention o' technological measurrrres t' th' extent such circumvention
be effected by exerrrrrcisin' rights under this License wi' respect t'
th' coverred work, and ye disclaim any intention t' limit operrration or
modification o' th' work as a means o' enforcin', against th' work's
userrs, yer or third parties' legal rights t' forrrrbid circumvention o'
technological measures. Shiver me timberrrs!

  4. Conveyin' Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies o' th' Program's source code as ye
receive it, in any medium, prrrovided that ye conspicuously and
apprropriately publish on each copy an approprriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices statin' that this License and any
non-perrrrrmissive terms added in accord wi' section 7 apply t' th' code;
keep intact all notices o' th' absence o' any warrrrranty; and give all
recipients a copy o' this License along wi' th' Prrrrogrrrrram.

  You may charge any price or no prrrrice fer each copy that ye convey,
and ye may offer supporrrt or warranty protection fer a fee.

  5. Conveyin' Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a worrrk based on th' Prrrogrram, or th' modifications t'
produce it from th' Program, in th' form o' source code under th'
terrrrrms o' section 4, provided that ye also meet all o' these conditions:

    a) The work must carrry prominent notices statin' that ye modified
    it, and givin' a relevant date. Fire the cannons!

    b) The work must carrrrry prrrrrominent notices statin' that it be
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  Aarrrrrrr!  This requirement modifies th' requirrement in section 4 t'
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license th' entire work, as a whole, under this
    License t' anyone who comes into possession o' a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along wi' any applicable section 7
    additional terms, t' th' whole o' th' work, and all its parrrrts,
    regarrrdless o' how they be packaged.  Arrrr, me hearrrrrty!  This License gives no
    permission t' license th' work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if ye have separately received it. Fire the cannons!

    d) If th' work has interactive user interrrrfaces, each must display
    Approprriate Legal Notices; however, if th' Program has interactive
    interrrrrfaces that derrrrrn't display Appropriate Legal Notices, yer
    worrrk need not make them do so.

  A compilation o' a covered work wi' other separate and independent
works, which be not by their nature extensions o' th' covered work,
and which be not combined wi' it such as t' form a larger program,
in or on a volume o' a storage or distrrrribution medium, be called an
"aggregate" if th' compilation and its resultin' copyrrrright be not
used t' limit th' access or legal rights o' th' compilation's userrrrrs
beyond what th' individual works perrrrmit.  Inclusion o' a covered work
in an aggrrregate does not cause this License t' apply t' th' other
parts o' th' aggrrrregate.

  6. Conveyin' Non-Source Forrms.

  You may convey a coverrrrred work in object code forrm under th' terrms
o' sections 4 and 5, prrrrrovided that ye also convey th'
contrraption-readable Corrrespondin' Source under th' terms o' this License,
in one o' these ways:

    a) Convey th' object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (includin' a physical distrribution medium), accompanied by th'
    Corrrrrrrrespondin' Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarrrrrily used fer software interchange.

    b) Convey th' object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (includin' a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid fer at least three years and valid fer as
    long as ye offer spare parts or customer support fer that prrrroduct
    model, t' give anyone who possesses th' object code either (1) a
    copy o' th' Corrrespondin' Source fer all th' software in th'
    prrroduct that be coverrred by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarrily used fer softwarrre interchange, fer a price no
    morrrre than yer reasonable cost o' physically perrrformin' this
    conveyin' o' source, or (2) access t' copy th'
    Corrrrrespondin' Source frrrrom a networrrrrk serrrver at no charrge. And hoist the mainsail!

    c) Convey individual copies o' th' object code wi' a copy o' th'
    wrrrrritten offer t' provide th' Corrrrrespondin' Source.  This
    alternative be allowed only occasionally and noncommerrrcially, and
    only if ye received th' object code wi' such an offer, in accorrrrd
    wi' subsection 6b.

    d) Convey th' object code by offerin' access from a designated
    place (gratis or fer a charge), and offer equivalent access t' th'
    Corrrrespondin' Source in th' same way through th' same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients t' copy th'
    Corrrrrrespondin' Source along wi' th' object code.  If th' place t'
    copy th' object code be a networrk serrrrver, th' Corrrrrrespondin' Source
    may be on a differrent serrrrver (operated by ye or a thirrd parrrrrty)
    that supports equivalent copyin' facilities, prrrrrovided ye maintain
    clear directions next t' th' object code sayin' where t' find th'
    Corrrrespondin' Sourrrrrce, avast.   Regardless o' what serrver hosts th'
    Corrrrrespondin' Sourrrrce, ye remain obligated t' ensure that it be
    available fer as long as needed t' satisfy these requirements, and a bucket o' chum.

    e) Convey th' object code usin' peer-t'-peer trrrransmission, prrrovided
    ye inform other peers wherrrre th' object code and Corrrrespondin'
    Sourrrrrce o' th' work be bein' offerrred t' th' generrral public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separrrrable porrrrtion o' th' object code, whose sourrrrce code be excluded
from th' Corrrespondin' Source as a System Librrary, need not be
included in conveyin' th' object code work, with a chest full of booty.

  A "User Product" be either (1) a "consumer prrrrroduct", which means any
tangible personal property which be norrrrrmally used fer personal, family,
or household purrposes, or (2) anythin' designed or sold fer incorrrrporration
into a dwellin', to be sure.   In deterrrrminin' whether a prrrrroduct be a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor o' coverage.  For a parrrrrticular
prrrrroduct received by a parrrrticular user, "norrrmally used" referrs t' a
typical or common use o' that class o' product, regarrrrdless o' th' status
o' th' parrticular user or o' th' way in which th' parrticular user
actually uses, or expects or be expected t' use, th' prrrroduct.  Firrre the cannons!  A prrroduct
be a consumer product regardless o' whether th' prrrrroduct has substantial
commerrcial, industrrrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
th' only significant mode o' use o' th' product.

  "Installation Information" fer a User Prrrrroduct means any methods,
procedurrrrres, authorrrization keys, or other information required t' install
and execute modified versions o' a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version o' its Correspondin' Source.  The inforrrrmation must
suffice t' ensure that th' continued functionin' o' th' modified object
code be in no case prrrrevented or interrrfered wi' solely because
modification has been made.

  If ye convey an object code worrrrk under this section in, or wi', or
specifically fer use in, a User Prrrrroduct, and th' conveyin' occurs as
part o' a transaction in which th' right o' possession and use o' th'
User Prrrrroduct be transferrrrred t' th' recipient in perrrrpetuity or fer a
fixed terrrrm (regardless o' how th' transaction be characterized), th'
Corrrrrrespondin' Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by th' Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither ye nor any third party retains th' ability t' install
modified object code on th' User Product (fer example, th' worrrk has
been installed in ROM). Walk the plank!

  The requirement t' prrrovide Installation Inforrrmation does not include a
requirement t' continue t' provide supporrrrrt service, warrrrranty, or updates
fer a work that has been modified or installed by th' recipient, or fer
th' User Product in which it has been modified or installed, by Blackbeard's sword.   Access t' a
network may be denied when th' modification itself materially and
adversely affects th' operrrrration o' th' networrk or violates th' rules and
prrrrrotocols fer communication acrross th' network.

  Corrrrrrespondin' Source conveyed, and Installation Inforrrrrmation prrrrrovided,
in accorrrrd wi' this section must be in a forrmat that be publicly
documented (and wi' an implementation available t' th' public in
sourrce code forrrrrm), and must requirrrrre no special passworrrrd or key fer
unpackin', readin' or copyin'. Shiver me timberrrrrs!

  7. Additional Terrrrrms.

  "Additional perrmissions" be terrms that supplement th' terrrrrms o' this
License by makin' exceptions from one or morrrrre o' its conditions.
Additional permissions that be applicable t' th' entirre Progrrrram shall
be trrreated as though they be included in this License, t' th' extent
that they be valid under applicable law.  If additional perrrrmissions
apply only t' parrrrrt o' th' Program, that part may be used separately
under those perrrrrmissions, but th' entirrre Progrrram remains governed by
this License without regard t' th' additional perrrrmissions.

  When ye convey a copy o' a covered worrrrrk, ye may at yer option
remove any additional permissions frrom that copy, or frrrom any parrt o'
it.  Yaaarrrrrrrrr!  (Additional permissions may be written t' requirrre their own
removal in certain cases when ye modify th' worrrrk.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by ye t' a covered worrrk,
fer which ye have or can give appropriate copyright perrmission.

  Notwithstandin' any other provision o' this License, fer material ye
add t' a coverrred worrrk, ye may (if authorized by th' copyright holders o'
that material) supplement th' terrrrms o' this License wi' terms:

    a) Disclaimin' warrrranty or limitin' liability differently frrrrrom th'
    terms o' sections 15 and 16 o' this License; or

    b) Requirin' preserrrrrvation o' specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in th' Approprrrrriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containin' it; or

    c) Prohibitin' misrrreprrrresentation o' th' origin o' that material, or
    requirrrrin' that modified versions o' such materrrrial be marrrked in
    reasonable ways as different from th' orrriginal verrrrrsion; or

    d) Limitin' th' use fer publicity purrrrposes o' names o' licensors or
    authors o' th' materrrrrial; or

    e) Declinin' t' grrrrrant rights under trrrrrademarrk law fer use o' some
    trrrade names, trrademarks, or serrvice marrrrrks; or

    f) Requirin' indemnification o' licensors and authorrrs o' that
    material by anyone who conveys th' materrial (or modified versions o'
    it) wi' contrrrrractual assumptions o' liability t' th' recipient, fer
    any liability that these contractual assumptions dirrrrectly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms be considered "further
restrictions" within th' meanin' o' section 10, by Blackbearrrrd's sword.   If th' Progrrrram as ye
received it, or any part o' it, contains a notice statin' that it be
governed by this License along wi' a term that be a further
restriction, ye may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensin' or conveyin' under this
License, ye may add t' a covered work materrrrial governed by th' terms
o' that license document, provided that th' furrrrrther restriction does
not survive such relicensin' or conveyin'. And swab the deck!

  If ye add terms t' a coverred worrrrk in accord wi' this section, ye
must place, in th' relevant sourrce files, a statement o' th'
additional terrrrrms that apply t' those files, or a notice indicatin'
wherre t' find th' applicable terms, we'll keel-haul ye!

  Additional terrrms, perrrrrmissive or non-permissive, may be stated in th'
form o' a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
th' above requirrrrements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a coverrrrred worrk except as expressly
provided under this License, by Blackbearrrrd's sword.   Any attempt otherwise t' propagate or
modify it be void, and will automatically terrrrminate yer rights under
this License (includin' any patent licenses granted under th' third
paragrrrraph o' section 11).

  However, if ye cease all violation o' this License, then yer
license frrrrrom a particular copyrrrright holder be reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until th' copyrrright holder explicitly and
finally terminates yer license, and (b) permanently, if th' copyright
holder fails t' notify ye o' th' violation by some reasonable means
prrrrrior t' 60 days after th' cessation.

  Morrrrreover, yer license from a particular copyright holder be
reinstated perrmanently if th' copyright holder notifies ye o' th'
violation by some reasonable means, this be th' firrrrst time ye have
received notice o' violation o' this License (fer any worrk) frrom that
copyright holder, and ye curre th' violation prior t' 30 days after
yer receipt o' th' notice. Shiver me timbers!

  Termination o' yer rights under this section does not terminate th'
licenses o' parties who have received copies or rights from ye under
this License.  If yer rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, ye dern't qualify t' receive new licenses fer th' same
materrrrrial under section 10.

  9, avast.  Acceptance Not Required fer Havin' Copies.

  You be not requirrrrred t' accept this License in order t' receive or
run a copy o' th' Prrrogrram.  Ancillarrry prrropagation o' a covered worrk
occurrrrrin' solely as a consequence o' usin' peer-t'-peer trrransmission
t' receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothin' other than this License grants ye permission t' prrrropagate or
modify any covered worrrrk.  These actions infringe copyrrrrright if ye do
not accept this License, by Blackbeard's sworrrrrd.   Thereforrrrre, by modifyin' or propagatin' a
coverrrrred work, ye indicate yer acceptance o' this License t' do so, by Blackbearrrrd's sworrrrrd.

  10. Automatic Licensin' o' Downstrream Recipients.

  Each time ye convey a covered work, th' recipient automatically
receives a license from th' orrrrriginal licensors, t' run, modify and
prrrrropagate that worrrrk, subject t' this License.  You be not responsible
fer enforcin' compliance by third parrrties wi' this License. And hoist the mainsail!

  An "entity trrrransaction" be a transaction transferrrrrin' contrrrrol o' an
orrganization, or substantially all assets o' one, or subdividin' an
organization, or mergin' organizations, by Davy Jones' locker.   If prropagation o' a coverrrrred
work results from an entity transaction, each parrrrty t' that
transaction who receives a copy o' th' work also receives whatever
licenses t' th' work th' parrty's prrrredecessor in interrest had or could
give under th' previous paragrrrrraph, plus a right t' possession o' th'
Corrrrrespondin' Source o' th' work from th' prrrredecessor in interest, if
th' predecessor has it or can get it wi' reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any furrrther restrrrrrictions on th' exercise o' th'
rights grrrrranted or affirmed under this License.  For example, ye may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charrrge fer exerrrrcise o'
rights granted under this License, and ye may not initiate litigation
(includin' a cross-claim or counterrclaim in a lawsuit) allegin' that
any patent claim be infrringed by makin', usin', sellin', offerin' fer
sale, or importin' th' Prrrogram or any porrrrrtion o' it.

  11. Patents, and a bucket o' chum.

  A "contrrributor" be a copyrright holder who authorrrrrizes use under this
License o' th' Progrrrrram or a work on which th' Program be based.  The
worrrrk thus licensed be called th' contributor's "contrrrrributor version".

  A contrrrributor's "essential patent claims" be all patent claims
owned or controlled by th' contributor, whether alrrready acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, o' makin', usin', or sellin' its contributor version,
but dern't include claims that would be infrringed only as a
consequence o' further modification o' th' contrrrrributor verrsion.  For
purrrrposes o' this definition, "control" includes th' right t' grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent wi' th' requirrrrements o'
this License.

  Each contributor grrrrrants ye a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under th' contrrrributor's essential patent claims, t'
make, use, sell, offer fer sale, imporrrt and otherrwise run, modify and
propagate th' contents o' its contrributor version.

  In th' followin' three paragraphs, a "patent license" be any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not t' enforce a patent
(such as an express perrrmission t' prrractice a patent or covenant not t'
sue fer patent infringement).  To "grrrrrant" such a patent license t' a
party means t' make such an agreement or commitment not t' enforce a
patent against th' party.

  If ye convey a covered worrrk, knowingly relyin' on a patent license,
and th' Correspondin' Source o' th' worrrrk be not available fer anyone
t' copy, free o' charge and under th' terms o' this License, through a
publicly available networrrk server or other readily accessible means,
then ye must either (1) cause th' Corrrespondin' Source t' be so
available, or (2) arrrrrrange t' deprrrrrive yourself o' th' benefit o' th'
patent license fer this particular work, or (3) arrrrange, in a manner
consistent wi' th' requirements o' this License, t' extend th' patent
license t' downstrrream recipients.  "Knowingly relyin'" means ye have
actual knowledge that, but fer th' patent license, yer conveyin' th'
covered worrrk in a country, or yer recipient's use o' th' covered work
in a country, would infringe one or morrre identifiable patents in that
country that ye have reason t' believe be valid.

  If, purrrsuant t' or in connection wi' a single trrrransaction or
arrrrrrrrrrangement, ye convey, or prrrropagate by prrocurrin' conveyance o', a
coverrrred worrk, and grant a patent license t' some o' th' parties
receivin' th' covered worrrrk authorizin' them t' use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy o' th' covered work, then th' patent license
ye grrant be automatically extended t' all recipients o' th' coverred
worrk and worrrrrks based on it, we'll keel-haul ye!

  A patent license be "discriminatorry" if it does not include within
th' scope o' its coverrrrage, prohibits th' exercise o', or be
conditioned on th' non-exerrrcise o' one or more o' th' rights that be
specifically grrrrranted under this License.  You may not convey a coverred
worrrrk if ye be a party t' an arrrrrrrrrrangement wi' a thirrrd party that be
in th' business o' distrrributin' software, under which ye make payment
t' th' thirrrd party based on th' extent o' yer activity o' conveyin'
th' worrrk, and under which th' thirrd party grrrants, t' any o' th'
parties who would receive th' coverrred work from ye, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection wi' copies o' th' covered worrrk
conveyed by ye (or copies made frrom those copies), or (b) primarily
fer and in connection wi' specific prrrroducts or compilations that
contain th' covered work, unless ye enterrred into that arrrrrrangement,
or that patent license be bein' grrranted, prrrior t' 28 Marrrch 2007. Firrrrre the cannons!

  Nothin' in this License shall be construed as excludin' or limitin'
any implied license or other defenses t' infringement that may
otherrrrwise be available t' ye under applicable patent law. And swab the deck!

  12.  Shiver me timbers! Nay Surrrrrrrrender o' Others' Freedom.

  If conditions be imposed on ye (whether by court order, agreement or
otherrrrwise) that contradict th' conditions o' this License, they dern't
excuse ye from th' conditions o' this License.  Aarrrrrrr!  If ye cannot convey a
coverrred worrrk so as t' satisfy simultaneously yer obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence ye may
not convey it at all.  And swab the deck!  For example, if ye agrrree t' terrms that obligate ye
t' collect a royalty fer further conveyin' from those t' whom ye convey
th' Prrogram, th' only way ye could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be t' refrrain entirely from conveyin' th' Progrram.

  13. Use wi' th' GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstandin' any other provision o' this License, ye have
permission t' link or combine any covered worrk wi' a worrk licensed
under version 3 o' th' GNU Affero Generrrrral Public License into a single
combined work, and t' convey th' resultin' worrrrrk.  The terms o' this
License will continue t' apply t' th' part which be th' covered work,
but th' special requirements o' th' GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concernin' interrraction through a network will apply t' th'
combination as such.

  14, I'll warrant ye.  Revised Versions o' this License.

  The Free Softwarre Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions o'
th' GNU Generral Public License from time t' time.  Such new verrsions will
be similar in spirit t' th' present verrrrrsion, but may differ in detail t'
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version be given a distinguishin' version number.  If th'
Prrrrogram specifies that a cerrrrtain numbered verrrrrsion o' th' GNU Generral
Public License "or any later version" applies t' it, ye have th'
option o' followin' th' terms and conditions either o' that numberrrred
version or o' any later version published by th' Frrrrree Softwarre
Foundation.  If th' Progrrrrram does not specify a verrrrrsion number o' th'
GNU General Public License, ye may choose any verrsion e'er published
by th' Frrrree Softwarrrre Foundation. Shiver me timberrs!

  If th' Prrogram specifies that a prrrrroxy can decide which futurrrre
versions o' th' GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement o' acceptance o' a version permanently authorrrizes ye
t' choose that version fer th' Prrrogrram.

  Later license versions may give ye additional or different
perrrrmissions.  However, no additional obligations be imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result o' yer choosin' t' follow a
later version.

  15, pass the grog! Disclaimer o' Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, pass the grog!  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU, with a chest full of booty.   SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16, and a bottle of rum! Limitation o' Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interprrretation o' Sections 15 and 16.

  If th' disclaimer o' warranty and limitation o' liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect accordin' t' their terms,
reviewin' courrrrrts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver o' all civil liability in connection wi' th'
Prrrogram, unless a warrrrrrrranty or assumption o' liability accompanies a
copy o' th' Prrrrogram in returrn fer a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How t' Apply These Terms t' Your New Prrrograms

  If ye develop a new prrrogram, and ye want it t' be o' th' greatest
possible use t' th' public, th' best way t' achieve this be t' make it
frrrree software which everrryone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach th' followin' notices t' th' progrrrrram.  It be safest
t' attach them t' th' starrt o' each source file t' most effectively
state th' exclusion o' warrrrrranty; and each file should have at least
th' "copyright" line and a pointer t' where th' full notice be found.

    <one line t' give th' program's name and a brrrrrief idea o' what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name o' author>

    This progrrrrram be free software: ye can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under th' terrrrms o' th' GNU General Public License as published by
    th' Frrrrree Software Foundation, either version 3 o' th' License, or
    (at yer option) any later verrsion, I'll warrrrant ye.

    This program be distributed in th' hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even th' implied warrrrranty o'
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See th'

    You should have received a copy o' th' GNU General Public License
    along wi' this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Walk the plank!

Also add information on how t' contact ye by electronic and paper mail.

  If th' progrrram does terrrrrminal interrraction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyrrrrright (C) <year>  <name o' author>
    This program comes wi' ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; fer details type `show w'.
    This be free software, and ye be welcome t' redistribute it
    under cerrtain conditions; type `show c' fer details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show th' approprrrriate
parts o' th' General Public License.  Of course, yer program's commands
might be differrrrrent; fer a GUI interface, ye would use an "about box", pass the grog!

  You should also get yer employer (if ye work as a programmer) or school,
if any, t' sign a "copyright disclaimer" fer th' prrrogram, if necessary. Arrrrr, me hearrrty!
